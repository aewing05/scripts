# scripts
A collection of quick scripts

## gen-templ.sh
Define a templates directory in the scripts directory. This holds text files for all templates. Currently, this script supports
- dailynote.txt
- journal.txt

Ensure permissions are granted for the script to execute on the template files (e.g. `chmod +x templates/journal.txt`)
