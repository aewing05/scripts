# scripts
A collection of quick scripts

<<<<<<< HEAD
## journal.sh
Takes no arguments. When run, it will create a file in an Obsidian vault, and populate the file with templated text. The file will be titled as the current date (e.g. `2024-01-01-journal-entry.md`)
=======

## journal.sh
Define a templates directory in the scripts directory. This holds text files for all templates. Currently, this script supports
- dailynote.txt
- journal.txt

Ensure permissions are granted for the script to execute on the template files (e.g. `chmod +x templates/journal.txt`)
